# Understanding Terraform Workflow

The Terraform workflow is a set of steps you follow to **create**, **update**, and **manage** your infrastructure using Terraform. 

It consists of four main commands: **init**, **plan**, **apply**, and **destroy**.

Using terraform workflow commands, we can avoid mistakes by showing exactly what changes will be made before applying them.

## How does it work?

**terraform init:** 

Initializes your working directory by downloading the necessary provider plugins and setting up the backend for storing the state file.

Example: If you’re using AWS, this command downloads the AWS provider plugin.

**terraform plan:**

Generates an execution plan showing what Terraform will do (e.g., create, update, or delete resources).

Example: If you’re adding an S3 bucket, plan will show that a new bucket will be created.

**terraform apply:**

Applies the changes to your infrastructure based on the plan.

Example: After reviewing the plan, running apply will create the S3 bucket in your AWS account.

**terraform destroy:**

Removes all resources managed by Terraform.

Example: If you no longer need the S3 bucket, destroy will delete it.

*Lets try to understand it with the usecase below:*

Imagine you’re setting up a web server. You use init to set up Terraform, plan to preview the server creation, apply to deploy it, and destroy to tear it down when it’s no longer needed.

**Here are some suggested best practices to apply:**

- Always run plan before apply to avoid surprises.

- Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes to your Terraform configurations.

- Regularly back up your state file to avoid losing track of your infrastructure.

This workflow makes managing infrastructure safe, predictable, and efficient!
