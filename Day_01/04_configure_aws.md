# Set Up Cloud Account Authentication

*Before Terraform can start spinning up resources in AWS, it needs access to your AWS account. That means setting up AWS credentials and making sure everything is properly configured. Letâ€™s break it down step by step.*

## Install AWS CLI

ðŸ‘‰ Head over to the [AWS CLI download page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and follow the instructions to install AWS CLI

ðŸ‘‰ Follow the installation steps, and once it's done, check if it's working by running:

```cmd
aws --version
```

If you see the version number, you're good to go!

## Create an IAM User

Now, letâ€™s create a secure user for Terraform to interact with AWS. 

Instead of using your root account, weâ€™ll create an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user with limited permissions.

- Log in to AWS Console: Use an admin account to access the AWS IAM Console. 

- Go to IAM â†’ Users â†’ Add User 

- Choose a username.

- Assign Permissions:
  For our first configuration, we will create an S3 bucket.
  Let's attach `AmazonS3FullAccess` access policy to our new user.
  Choose `attach policies directly`and search for `AmazonS3FullAccess`. Select the check box against the access policy and click on Next button.

  If you need access to other AWS services, assign relevant permissions.
  Click `Create User` finalize.

- Create User & Save Credentials: AWS will generate an Access Key ID and Secret Access Keyâ€”save these somewhere safe (like a password manager). Youâ€™ll need them in the next step!

## Configure AWS CLI Credentials

To set up credentials, use the AWS CLI command 'aws configure'.

```cmd
aws configure
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter:

1. AWS Access Key ID
2. AWS Secret Access Key
3. Default region name (e.g., us-east-1)
4. Default output format (leave as None)

```cmd
AWS Access Key ID [****************7WPF]:
AWS Secret Access Key [****************giL/]:
Default region name [us-west-2]:
Default output format [json]:
```
